This section features the course assignments, the majority of which are of two types: responses to poems and imitations of poems. There is also a selection of student work, courtesy of the authors and used here with permission.

| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Introduction | &nbsp; |
| 2 | Favorite Poems | Bring copies for all of a favorite poem to class with copies of a one-page explanation of why the poem is one of your favorites. You will read poem and explanation in class.

| 3 | Charles Olson's Poem | Write a one-page response to Olson's poem. |
| 4 | Olson Imitations | You are free in terms of length, but you must imitate Olson's collage form and his subject matter, the nature of change. |
| 5 | Robert Creeley's Poems | Write a one-page response to one or more of Creeley's poems. |
| 6 | Creeley Imitations |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} You may write more than one poem but you must imitate Creeley's use of speech.

| 7 | Barbara Guest's Poems | Write a one-page response to one or more of Guest's poems. |
| 8 | Guest Imitations |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Guest's language is more abstract than either Olson or Creeley's. It is this quality you must try to imitate. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} {{< h 3 >}}Student Work{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Guest imitation by C.

| 9 | James Schuyler's Poem and Letter | Write a one-page response to Schuyler's poem and letter. |
| 10 | Schuyler Imitations | Schuyler's "February" is a view poem. You may do as he does and look out a window but be bold. There are many other possible views. |
| 11 | Frank O'Hara Poems |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Write a one-page response to one or more of O'Hara's poems. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} {{< h 3 >}}Student Work{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} O'Hara Response by Megan Sherkow ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/ohara_response)) {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 12 | O'Hara Imitations |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} O'Hara called this sort of poem "I do this, I do that."

| 14 | Whalen Imitations |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Whalen's poems, all of which are dated at the end, read like diaries in which he lets his mind, and the poem, skip from subject to subject. This is the technique and spirit that you should imitate. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} {{< h 3 >}}Student Work{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Whalen imitation by C.
